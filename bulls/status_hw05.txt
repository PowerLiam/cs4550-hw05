Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?

Liam Brown

2. What hostname did you deploy to?

hw05.lnbtech.us

3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

Elixir itself, the syntax can be unintuitive, and the lack of type 
checking leads to nasty errors.  If you accidentally recurse forever,
the process dies and restarts silently, so it's hard to tell what is going
on.

4. What part of your application state is on the server?

The secret and the guesses, along with how many bulls and cows each guess has.

5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?

The guesses, along with how many bulls and cows each guess has.
(This state just mirrors the server state, but does not include the
secret)
